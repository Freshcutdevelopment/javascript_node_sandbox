# JavaScript Node Sandbox
A basic node application set up with gulp and BrowserSync. This is useful as a starting point for NodeJS hosted JS applications.

# Getting Started
Run the following commands to clone the repository, install the dependencies, and then spin up a simple [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server with [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) and [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to watch for changes to files and refresh the browser when any changes occure.

1. git clone https://github.com/Freshcutdevelopment/javascript_node_sandbox.git
2. npm install
3. gulp
4. You should now have the sandbox up and running ready to start building out your application.
