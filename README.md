# JavaScript Node Sandbox
A basic node application set up with gulp and BrowserSync. This is useful as a starting point for NodeJS hosted JS applications.

# Getting Started
Run the following commands to clone the repository, install the dependencies, and then spin up a simple Express server with BrowserSync and NodeMon to watch for changes to files and refresh the browser when any changes occure.

1. git clone [https://github.com/Freshcutdevelopment/javascript_node_sandbox.git]
2. npm install
3. gulp
4. You should now have the sandbox up and running ready to start building out your application.
